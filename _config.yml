  Hi, I'm Mia. I hold a MS degree in Applied Statistics from New York University and a BS degree in Applied Statistics from Qingdao University. 
  Currently, I'm an adjunct instructor at New York University and work as a research assistant for Professor [Marc Scott](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/marc-scott).
  My research interest lies in
    - Statistical machine learning and its implementation in biology and bioimage analysis.
    - Sequence analysis.
    - Bootstrap methods and fiducial methods.
    - Iâ€™m also open to explore other research areas.
  
  In my spare time, I enjoy cycling and playing tennis. A fun fact about me: I survived a summer in the Bay Area relying solely on my bicycle for transportation! I also expand my passion for machine learning and computer vision into my daily life. [Alan Cha](https://github.com/Alan-Cha) and I am building a wigglegram camera using Raspberry Pi.

      description: | 
        - Developed four interval estimation methods for zero-inflated gamma distributions based on fiducial inference, Box-Cox transformation, parametric bootstrap, and the method of variance of estimates recovery (MOVER); designed and conducted computer experiment to compare the performance of the four estimation methods ([code can be found here](https://github.com/Xinming-Dai/ZIgamma_confidence_intervals))
        - Designed confidence intervals constructed using a pivot quantity for semiparametric single-index models; carried out simulations for these new methods in R
        - Established a novel addable ordinary differential equation model with the group MCP penalty for reconstruction of gene regulatory networks with data from DREAM Systems Biology Challenges
