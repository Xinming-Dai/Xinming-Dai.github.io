about_content: | 
  Hi, I'm Xinming. I have a background in mathematics, programming, and statistics. 
  I am passionate about using artificial intelligence and mathematical models to solve complex, real-world problems. 
  I am eager to use my skills in statistics to uncover patterns in data and am always looking to expand my knowledge and expertise in new fields and technologies. 
  
  Currently, I am actively seeking entry-level positions in software engineering and data science.
